# Winery_Database

## Backgorund and Data Questions:

This started as the final project for my Database Administration class at Syracuse University. The task was to develop a simple database on a topic of our choosing. I chose to create a database for a fictious winery (which I called Sonoma Quality Libations, or SQL for short).
 
## Files:

Winery_Database_Report.pdf: The final report for the IST659 final project.

Winery_Database_Code.sql: The SQL file for the final project (though the code is also written as an appendix to the final report). Microsoft SQL server is required to run this script.
